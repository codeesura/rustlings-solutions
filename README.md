# Rustlings Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the solutions to the exercises from the Rustlings course. This course is a fantastic way to learn the Rust programming language through hands-on coding exercises. If you're having trouble with any exercise, you've come to the right place. Here, you can find proposed solutions, along with explanations to aid in your understanding.

Please note that these are suggested solutions and the beauty of programming is that there can be more than one solution to any given problem. Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, but I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own before looking at the solutions here.

## About Rustlings

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a collection of small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. It is a fantastic way to get up to speed with the Rust language. The exercises are focused on different aspects of the language, from basic concepts like variable declaration and mutation, to more complex topics like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
